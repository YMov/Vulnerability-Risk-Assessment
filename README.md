# Vulnerability-Risk-Assessment
Vulnerabilities reports of software systems are widely used by security researchers for security analysis (e.g. software reliability analysis). Vulnerabilities are software faults, which can be exploited as a result of security attacks. Many researchers have used data from various vulnerability databases to study trends of discovery of new vulnerabilities, proposed various models for fitting the discovery times and predicting when new vulnerabilities may be discovered for a given product. Estimating the discovery times for new vulnerabilities is useful both for vendors of these products as well as the end-users as it can help them with their resource allocation strategies over time.
