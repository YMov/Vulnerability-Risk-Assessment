# Vulnerability-Risk-Assessment
Vulnerabilities reports of software systems are widely used by security researchers for security analysis (e.g. software reliability analysis). Vulnerabilities are software faults, which can be exploited as a result of security attacks [1]. Many researchers have used data from various vulnerability databases to study trends of discovery of new vulnerabilities, proposed various models for fitting the discovery times and predicting when new vulnerabilities may be discovered for a given product. 
One way of analyzing vulnerability data is to relate them to the relative exploit and patch databases. Generally, a patch is a piece of software developed to fix or remove a specific vulnerability in a computer program. An exploit is also defined as a piece of software or sequence of commands developed to take advantage of the vulnerability to face the computer program with unintended problems. 
Allodi and Massacci [2] showed that only 2.1% out of 49599 vulnerabilities reported by NVD are exploited. In another study by Younis and Malaiya [3], it has been shown that out of 486 Internet Explorer vulnerabilities, only 6.8% are exploited in real world. Thus, it is necessary for vendors to first identify the vulnerabilities at risk of being exploited, and then detect those with the potential of having an exploit in shorter time interval starting from their disclosure date. Detecting those vulnerabilities with short exploiting time is useful for vendors of these products as it can help them with their resource allocation strategies over time (e.g. scheduling the releasing time of a new patch, also known as “patch management”)
To analyze exploit and patch dynamics, one should focus on the published date of vulnerability, the date the patch was made available, and the date the exploit was detected. For this project, we first detect the vulnerabilities that were exploited in a short period of time (e.g. 2-7 days) and train a classifier based upon the features reported for those vulnerabilities. Then, we will validate the accuracy of the classifier through importing of a test sample. General variables we use in our research are defined as follows: 
-	Published dates (Vulnerabilities/exploits/patches): The earliest date when a specific vulnerability/exploit/patch was released. 
-	Days to Exploit: It is equal to the difference between exploit dates and published dates of vulnerabilities (negative integers mean that a host of vulnerabilities were being exploited before they were ever published). 
-	Days to Patch: The difference between patch dates and published dates of vulnerabilities. 


-	Days Patch to Exploit: The difference between patch dates and published dates of exploits. 
-	CVSS Score: It states the level of criticality of the vulnerability (Low, Medium, High) 
-	Vulnerability Type
-	Description: The text information within vulnerabilities reports, which includes useful information about how a given vulnerability was detected or exploited (e.g. type of exploit/ attack)

The data used in this research has been collected from six different public repositories of vulnerability data sources including the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [4], the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database [5], the CVE Details data source [6], the Security database [7], the SecurityFocus data source [8], and the CXSecurity database [9]. We also collected the data exploited data from Exploit Database [10]. We then stored the data in our own database from the mentioned public repositories of vulnerabilities using MySQL, and identified each vulnerability by its Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) identifier. We used the CVE identifier to compare the reporting date of each vulnerability in NVD, with the dates in other public repositories on vulnerabilities. We then updated the reporting date on our database to the earliest date that a given vulnerability was known in any of these databases.
We used the NVD as the backbone of comparisons because it includes all the vulnerabilities that can be found in some of the other data sources. Even though some information might be missing in the NVD, it includes the fields that allows to search for the missing information in the other data sources. One example is the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier, which is only present in the NVD but can be used in combination with the CVE identifier to extract information from different sources. Another example is the vulnerability type that is only present in the CVE Details table.
